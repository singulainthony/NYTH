# Why Your Neighbor's Kid Probably Isn't the Best AI Teacher

Your grandson set up your iPhone. The kid down the street "fixed" your computer that one time. And now that everyone's talking about ChatGPT, you're wondering if you should just ask them to show you how it works.

Here's the problem: being good with tech doesn't mean being good at *teaching* it.

I've heard some version of this story dozens of times from seniors in North York:

"My nephew tried to show me ChatGPT, but he clicked through everything so fast I couldn't follow. When I asked questions, I could tell he was getting impatient. I didn't want to bother him, so I just pretended I understood."

Sound familiar?

## The Real Issue

When someone grows up with technology, they suffer from something called "the curse of knowledge." They literally cannot remember what it's like to *not* understand this stuff. A smartphone or AI tool is as intuitive to them as a light switch. They don't get why you're confused because *they've never been confused by it*.

So they use jargon you don't know. They go too fast. They skip steps. And you end up feeling stupid for asking "basic" questions.

## Why AI Is Actually Different

ChatGPT isn't just another app to figure out. It's genuinely different from anything you've used before. You don't just "get it" by watching someone type for five minutes.

Here's what makes it different:

**The conversation matters.**

Unlike Google (where you search and get links), ChatGPT actually *talks* with you. Learning to ask follow-up questions, refine what you're asking for, and guide the AI back on track when it misunderstands—that's a skill. It takes practice.

**It's not just for tech people.**

The seniors who do best with AI aren't the ones who already know computers. They're the curious ones who take time to understand *why* the AI responds the way it does. That understanding doesn't come from a quick demo.

**The uses are personal.**

ChatGPT can help you write an email to your landlord, understand what your doctor actually said, plan meals around your diet, or research a hobby. Generic tutorials don't know what *you* need help with.

## What Learning AI Actually Looks Like

When I work with people, here's what we actually do:

We start with *your* goals. Not a tutorial. I ask what you wish you had help with—writing emails? Understanding something you read? Planning trips? Then we use AI to solve *that* problem.

We go at your pace. I explain every click. I wait until you tell me you're ready to move on. I repeat things as many times as you need, without making you feel silly for asking.

I write everything down. After our session, you get step-by-step instructions for everything we covered. No trying to remember what that button was called.

And crucially: *you* do it, not just watch me. That's how confidence builds.

## What People Actually Tell Me Afterward

"I wrote an email to my son's teacher that I was actually proud of—didn't have to ask anyone to help me word it."

"I asked ChatGPT to explain my doctor's report in plain English, and for the first time I understood what it meant."

"I felt confident booking my own vacation instead of having my daughter do it for me."

"I researched something I'm passionate about and learned things I never would have found on my own."

That's the difference between "learning tech" and actually gaining independence.

## Why This Matters Now

AI isn't going away. It's getting woven into more of the tools you already use. Learning to use it confidently means:

- You won't be left behind as services add AI features
- You'll spot AI-generated scams (they're getting more sophisticated)
- You can research topics thoroughly and make better decisions
- You'll stay connected with family who are using these tools

## What "Good Enough" Looks Like

You don't need to become an expert. Most of my students just need to:

- Know how to start a conversation with ChatGPT
- Learn to ask better questions (it's a skill)
- Understand how to check if AI-generated information is accurate
- Use AI for 2-3 specific tasks that matter to them
- Feel confident experimenting on their own

That's it. No coding. No building AI systems. Just using a tool that makes life easier.
