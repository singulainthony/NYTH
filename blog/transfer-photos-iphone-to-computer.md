# How to Transfer Photos from iPhone to Computer: A Step-by-Step Guide for Seniors

*Last updated: February 2026*

If your iPhone is running out of storage space, or you want to keep your precious photos safe on your computer, you're not alone. As a tech helper who works with seniors throughout North York and Willowdale, this is one of the most common questions I receive.

The good news? Transferring photos from your iPhone to your computer is easier than you think. In this guide, I'll walk you through three simple methods — no technical jargon, no rushing, just clear steps you can follow at your own pace.

## Why Transfer Your Photos?

Before we start, here's why taking the time to transfer your photos is worth it:

- **Free up space**: iPhones can fill up quickly, especially if you take lots of photos
- **Create backups**: If something happens to your phone, your memories are safe on your computer
- **Easier to share**: It's often simpler to email or print photos from a computer
- **Better organization**: Computers make it easier to sort and find specific photos

## Method 1: Using a USB Cable (Recommended for Most People)

This is the most reliable method and works with both Windows PCs and Mac computers.

### What You'll Need:
- Your iPhone
- Your charging cable (the one that came with your phone)
- Your computer

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

**Step 1: Connect your iPhone to your computer**
- Plug the USB end of your cable into your computer
- Plug the other end into your iPhone
- If a message pops up on your iPhone asking "Trust This Computer?" — tap "Trust" and enter your passcode

**Step 2: Open File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac)**
- On Windows: Look for the yellow folder icon in your taskbar, or press the Windows key + E
- On Mac: Click the Finder icon (blue smiling face) in your dock

**Step 3: Find your iPhone**
- On Windows: Look under "This PC" or "Computer" on the left side. You should see your iPhone listed as a device
- On Mac: Your iPhone will appear in the Finder sidebar under "Locations"

**Step 4: Open the photos folder**
- Double-click on your iPhone icon
- Look for a folder called "DCIM" (this stands for Digital Camera IMages)
- Open that folder — you'll see more folders with names like "100APPLE" — these contain your photos

**Step 5: Copy your photos**
- Select the photos you want to transfer (you can click and drag to select multiple, or press Ctrl+A to select all)
- Right-click and choose "Copy" (or press Ctrl+C)
- Navigate to where you want to save them on your computer (like your Pictures folder)
- Right-click and choose "Paste" (or press Ctrl+V)

> **Anthony's Pro Tip**: Create a new folder on your computer with today's date (like "iPhone Photos Feb 2026") to keep things organized. This makes it much easier to find photos later!

**Step 6: Wait for the transfer**
- Depending on how many photos you have, this could take a few minutes
- You'll see a progress window showing the files copying
- Don't disconnect your iPhone until it's finished!

**Step 7: Safely disconnect**
- On Windows: Click the little USB icon in your system tray (bottom right) and select "Eject iPhone"
- On Mac: Click the eject icon next to your iPhone in Finder
- Now you can unplug the cable

## Method 2: Using iCloud for Windows

If you prefer wireless transfers and have iCloud set up, this method works well.

### What You'll Need:
- Your iPhone with iCloud Photos enabled
- iCloud for Windows installed on your PC
- Wi-Fi connection

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

**Step 1: Check iCloud on your iPhone**
- Open the Settings app
- Tap your name at the top
- Tap "iCloud"
- Make sure "Photos" is turned ON
- This means your photos are automatically backing up to iCloud

**Step 2: Install iCloud for Windows**
- On your computer, go to the Microsoft Store or Apple website
- Download and install "iCloud for Windows"
- Sign in with the same Apple ID you use on your iPhone

**Step 3: Choose what to sync**
- During setup, check the box for "Photos"
- Click "Options" next to Photos
- Make sure "iCloud Photos" is selected
- Click "Done" then "Apply"

**Step 4: Access your photos**
- Open File Explorer
- Look for "iCloud Photos" in the left sidebar
- Click on it
- You'll see a "Downloads" folder — this is where your photos from iCloud appear
- Photos may take some time to download depending on your internet speed

> **Anthony's Pro Tip**: This method keeps your photos synced. If you delete a photo from your iPhone, it will also delete from iCloud. Make sure to copy photos to a different folder on your computer if you want to keep them after deleting from your phone.

## Method 3: Using Google Photos

If you already use Gmail or other Google services, Google Photos is a great option.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

**Step 1: Install Google Photos on your iPhone**
- Open the App Store
- Search for "Google Photos"
- Download and install the app
- Sign in with your Google (Gmail) account

**Step 2: Back up your photos**
- Open the Google Photos app
- It will ask if you want to back up your photos — tap "Turn On"
- The app will start uploading your photos to Google's servers
- This can take a while if you have many photos — leave it plugged in and connected to Wi-Fi

**Step 3: Access on your computer**
- On your computer, open any web browser
- Go to photos.google.com
- Sign in with the same Google account
- You'll see all your photos here!

**Step 4: Download to your computer**
- Select the photos you want (click on them)
- Click the three dots (⋯) in the top right
- Choose "Download"
- The photos will save to your Downloads folder

> **Anthony's Pro Tip**: Google Photos gives you 15 GB of free storage (shared with Gmail and Google Drive). If you have more photos than that, you may need to pay for additional storage or use one of the other methods.

## Tips for Organizing Your Photos

Once you've transferred your photos, here's how to keep them organized:

**Create folders by date or event:**
- Right-click in your Pictures folder
- Select "New Folder"
- Name it something like "2026 Family Photos" or "Sarah's Wedding"
- Drag and drop photos into the appropriate folders

**Delete duplicates:**
- Sometimes you'll have the same photo in multiple places
- Take a few minutes to delete the extras to save space

**Back up your computer:**
- Now that your photos are on your computer, consider backing them up
- External hard drives are affordable and provide peace of mind
- Cloud backup services like OneDrive or Dropbox work too
