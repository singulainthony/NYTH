                <h1>How to Spot Tech Scams: Red Flags Every Senior Should Know</h1>
            </header>

            <div class="blog-content">
                <p>Scammers love to target seniors because they know many older adults are less familiar with technology. But here's the good news: once you know what to look for, spotting scams becomes much easier. In my work helping seniors throughout North York, I've seen every trick in the book — and I'm going to teach you how to recognize them.</p>

                <img src="images/scam-protection.png" alt="A confident senior person using their phone safely with security protection symbols" class="blog-image">
                <p class="blog-image-caption">Knowing the warning signs is the best protection against tech scams.</p>

                <h2>The Golden Rule: When in Doubt, Hang Up or Delete</h2>
                <p>Before we dive into specific scams, remember this: legitimate companies will never pressure you to act immediately. They won't threaten you. And they won't ask for sensitive information like passwords or Social Insurance Numbers over the phone or email.</p>

                <div class="safety-tip">
                    <strong>Your Safety Rule:</strong> If something feels wrong, it probably is. Hang up the phone. Close the email. Take a breath. Then verify through a trusted source.
                </div>

                <h2>Scam #1: The "Tech Support" Call</h2>
                <p>This is one of the most common scams targeting seniors. Here's how it works:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You receive a phone call from someone claiming to be from "Microsoft," "Apple," or "Windows Support"</li>
                    <li>They tell you your computer has a virus or has been hacked</li>
                    <li>They ask for remote access to your computer</li>
                    <li>They demand payment to "fix" the problem</li>
                </ul>

                <img src="images/phone-scam-warning.png" alt="Person looking skeptical at a suspicious phone call with warning symbols" class="blog-image">
                <p class="blog-image-caption">Be suspicious of unexpected calls claiming to be from tech support companies.</p>

                <div class="red-flag">
                    <strong>🚩 RED FLAG:</strong> Real tech companies like Microsoft and Apple will NEVER call you unexpectedly to tell you about a problem with your computer. They don't monitor your computer for viruses. These calls are always scams.
                </div>

                <h3>What to Do:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Hang up immediately — don't engage with them</li>
                    <li>Never give them remote access to your computer</li>
                    <li>Never give them payment information</li>
                    <li>If you're worried your computer might actually have a problem, call a trusted local tech helper (like me!)</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Scam #2: The "Your Account Has Been Compromised" Email</h2>
                <p>You get an email that looks like it's from your bank, Amazon, PayPal, or another company you trust. It says your account has been locked or compromised and you need to click a link to verify your information.</p>

                <img src="images/email-phishing.png" alt="Suspicious email in inbox with warning indicators" class="blog-image">
                <p class="blog-image-caption">Look for warning signs in emails asking you to click links or verify account information.</p>

                <div class="red-flag">
                    <strong>🚩 RED FLAG:</strong> These emails often have urgent language like "Act now!" or "Your account will be closed!" They may have spelling mistakes or slightly wrong email addresses (like "amaz0n.com" instead of "amazon.com").
                </div>

                <h3>How to Spot Fake Emails:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Check the sender's email address:</strong> Hover over the sender's name to see the actual email. Scammers use addresses that look similar but aren't quite right</li>
                    <li><strong>Look for spelling mistakes:</strong> Legitimate companies proofread their emails carefully</li>
                    <li><strong>Hover over links before clicking:</strong> See where the link actually goes — don't click if it looks suspicious</li>
                    <li><strong>When in doubt:</strong> Open a new browser window and log into your account directly — never through email links</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Scam #3: The "You've Won a Prize" Scam</h2>
                <p>You get a call, email, or pop-up saying you've won a lottery, sweepstakes, or prize. But there's a catch — you need to pay a fee to claim it, or provide your bank information.</p>

                <div class="red-flag">
                    <strong>🚩 RED FLAG:</strong> If you didn't enter a contest, you didn't win anything. And real prizes never require you to pay money upfront to receive them.
                </div>

                <h2>Scam #4: The "Grandparent Emergency" Scam</h2>
                <p>You get a call from someone claiming to be your grandchild. They're in trouble — they've been arrested, had an accident, or are stranded somewhere — and they need money sent immediately.</p>

                <div class="red-flag">
                    <strong>🚩 RED FLAG:</strong> Scammers often say "Don't tell Mom and Dad!" to prevent you from verifying the story. They may also have some information about your grandchild from social media.
                </div>

                <h3>What to Do:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Ask for their name and say you'll call them back</li>
                    <li>Call your grandchild directly on their regular number</li>
                    <li>Or call their parents to verify the story</li>
                    <li>Never send money through wire transfers, gift cards, or cryptocurrency — these are untraceable</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Scam #5: Fake Investment Opportunities</h2>
                <p>You receive a call or see an ad promising amazing returns on an investment — often in cryptocurrency, gold, or some "exclusive" opportunity. They pressure you to act fast before the opportunity disappears.</p>

                <div class="red-flag">
                    <strong>🚩 RED FLAG:</strong> If an investment sounds too good to be true, it is. Legitimate investment advisors don't cold-call seniors with "limited time" offers.
                </div>

                <h2>Scam #6: The "Verify Your Information" Text</h2>
                <p>You get a text message from what looks like your bank, Canada Post, or a delivery company. It says there's a problem with your account or package, and you need to click a link to verify your information.</p>

                <div class="red-flag">
                    <strong>🚩 RED FLAG:</strong> Banks and delivery companies don't send texts asking you to click links and enter personal information. These are called "smishing" scams (SMS phishing).
                </div>

                <h2>What to Do If You've Been Scammed</h2>
                <p>If you think you've fallen for a scam, don't be embarrassed — it happens to intelligent people every day. Here's what to do:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Contact your bank immediately:</strong> If you gave payment information, call your bank or credit card company right away. They may be able to stop the transaction</li>
                    <li><strong>Change your passwords:</strong> If you gave password information, change your passwords immediately on any affected accounts</li>
                    <li><strong>Report it:</strong> File a report with the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre at 1-888-495-8501 or <a href="https://antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca" target="_blank">antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Get help securing your computer:</strong> If a scammer had remote access to your computer, have a trusted professional check it</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="safety-tip">
                    <strong>Remember:</strong> Scammers want you to feel embarrassed so you don't report them or tell anyone. Don't let them win — speak up and get help.
                </div>

                <h2>How to Protect Yourself Going Forward</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Never give personal information over the phone</strong> unless YOU called a verified number</li>
                    <li><strong>Use strong, unique passwords</strong> for each account (a password manager can help)</li>
                    <li><strong>Enable two-factor authentication</strong> on important accounts like email and banking</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep your software updated</strong> — updates often include security fixes</li>
                    <li><strong>When in doubt, ask someone you trust</strong> before taking action</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>When to Ask for Help</h2>
